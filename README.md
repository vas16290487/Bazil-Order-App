## Bazil

### I. Initiative

Bazil is in need of an application that shows the service that they offer. Bazil is a independent pizzaria that offer traditional style pizza to locals within 4 miles. Bazil has a range of pizza on offer for a range of customers. They need an application that presents the services that they offer in a user friendly enviroment. A mobile app is needed to be created and show the food that is being offered, any sides, drinks, the cost of the items and the total. Addiitionally the app needs to have the option of delivery or collection, the details of contact and the location of the takeaway; all of which is in the application.

### User requirements

     -The application must be free.
     -The design needs to be clear and straight forward, freindly GUI
     -Easy to use : clear titles, easy to navigate...
     -Able to view all the menu items, sides and drinks. Including if something is out of stock.
     -Allow the user to decide if they want to order for collection or delivery
     -Have contact details about the restaurant: email, phone number and address.
     -Should have a page for the total, quanity and the cost per item (checkout page).
        
        
### II. Epics and User Stories

Epics

Outlining the main fuctions of the Application

The main function of the application needs to have a home, contact us, menu page and a checkout page. All of which are functional. Each page needs to have appraiote buttons / information that allows the user to interact. For example, if a button says add to basket, when that button is clicked it must add the amount of items and mutiply it by the cost of the item. If a pizza costs £15 and the user wants two, two pizza must be added to the basket and the total must be £30.

Non-Functional Requirements

This is the layout and the high fidelity design. Asthetic or non essential requirements is refering to what the actual app looks like. The text must be in a readable font, the text must go down the page and not across the screen for an app, there needs to be banners that are easy to identfy and the look of the app needs to be related to the style of the business.

These requirements were agreed upon research that was carried out

#### User Stories

Target audience 

A target Audience is a specificed group of people that have been identied to be potential consumers. The audince are specified based on the product / service that is being offerded. From the product the business will identified who will use the product, by questioning the age range, if there is a specific gender, occupation and location...

Bazil's target audience is any person that doesn't want to directly order through the phone or a website. Bazil is offering the ability to have a simpler version of the website on an application. Having this on in an application, it allows the customers to have portability and availability whenever they want. Bazil's target audience is non specific to gender and has a age range of 16 and above. The reason for this is that below 16 most wont be able to pay by card and agree to the terms of service. Bazil is a pizzaria so, it doesn't need to specify the gender. The application is also accessable for every person.

### User Persona

Name: Emma Jenkins

Gender: Female

Age: 16

Occupation: Student

Background: Emma is a college student who doesn’t have a lot of time. Emma also has social anxiety; therefore, it is much easier for Emma to order through an app, as Emma can put Emma’s contact details into the app and card details.
Emma lives within the delivery radius and finds Bazil the tastiest pizza in 3 miles. Emma also believes that Bazil’s Pizza is more affordable than other competitors.

How will your planned product meet the user requirements?

From this user persona, the user's back ground was broken down and analysed. This was to see what the user will be looking for when using the application. For Emma, she needs to have a quick and simple app that allows her to order the food she wants. Emma doesn't want to have to talk to someone as she fumbles over her words and her anxiety increases. She still wants to make an order so an app is ideal; the website take too long. Using an application means she can order food much quicker and put her details in with less hassle. Emma also uses the location feature on her phone to order within the distance of the takeaway, making it quicker to see if she is in delivery distance.

User 2:

Name: David Kensington

Gender: Male

Age: 50

Occupation: Self-employed

Background: David has a hearing impairment and does not like to speak over the phone. David uses the application to order without being rushed due to the impairments. David finds it much easier to input his details and order through the application.

How will your planned product meet the user requirements?

From this user persona, the user's back ground was broken down and analysed. This was to see what the user will be looking for when using the application. For David, he relies on reading the text on the application. So, the text used needs to be clear and understanding, needs to be structured in a clear format. The text needs to be big enough or the ability to zoom in. The text also need to go down the page instead of across and making him scroll across the screen; it can be tedious and annoying. 

How will your planned product meet the user requirements?

The application will use the user persona as a guidence of what the user exspects and what is needed for them to use the app. The use of research is going to help compare and discuss what needs to be included. Refer to figure 1 in designs:
[Figure 1](https://github.com/AoifeW123/Unit-9-Software-Development-Lifecycles-/blob/master/Basil/README.md#designs)


### III. Genre

The type of Genre for this applcaition  is a business app. This is as the applcation is offering a service in exchange for money the user has. The user pays for items of their choice and they pay the amount the buisness states.

### IV. Technical Details

Platform

The platform that would be used is andriod studio. Andriod studio is a type of IDE that is specificaly for an andriod app. The app is free to install and use. This platform is widely used and has many tutorials online that are visual, audio and written text based. The andriod developer wesbite states that the andrios studio "offers even more features that enhance your productivity when building Android apps, such as:

     -A flexible Gradle-based build system
     -A fast and feature-rich emulator
     -A unified environment where you can develop for all Android devices
     -Instant Run to push changes to your running app without building a new APK
     -Code templates and GitHub integration to help you build common app features and import sample code
     -Extensive testing tools and frameworks
     -Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version compatibility, and other problems
     -C++ and NDK support
     -Built-in support for Google Cloud Platform, making it easy to integrate Google Cloud Messaging and App Engine"


Programming Language/Enviroment

The Java programming language would be used in conjuction with the Andriod 5.0 API. The reason for this, is if the app was created a wide range of devices would have to be able to use the app; depending on the current Andriod API version they support. Java would offer the ability to make the app be supported on as many andriod devices as possible.

Programming Challenges

Unfortunately due to a short dealine the creation of any prototype of the applcaiton was not possible, but there will be a discussion on the low and high fidelity design prototypes. When it came to the low fidelity design the main issue was putting too much into the design. Originally the app would have too many features that were not needed. 

To solve this me and Eric used a planned meeting to sit down and discussed what the basics are that meet our requirements. We agreed that we just needed a home page, contact us, checkout page and a menu page. We also agreed that there needs to be the required information (types of pizza, side drinks...), clickable buttons that take the user to the page and a friendly GUI. Low fidelity was orignially going to be made in photoshop but was chnaged to pen and paper as it was eaier.

When it came to the high fidelity design we had to create, the first step to choose an application that allowed to edit photos, create photos... Paint was a option but lacked some features that were needed; easy selection of layers and being able to select an image and only more that image. We ended up deciding oh using photoshot as it was the best photoediting software that was aviable to us. Photoshop was preinstalled where we had our planned meeting, so the creation of the designs took place during the meetings. During this process we reflected back onto the mock designs and used them as a foundation on the high fidelity designs; except we added more GUI to the designs.

### Designs

Figure 9:

After the desings are made it would be best to gain client feedback. Client feed back would include the appearence of the designs, if the user requirements match what are being asked and if any add oons can be funded by the client. This is getting the opinon of how the client feels about the progrres made so far and if any changes are needed.

The challenges we would face when it came to the programming aspect is that only one of use would have some knowledge about java and adriod studio: Eric. The other would have to learn how to use andriod studio and have at least some basic knowledge on Java. To over come this all of use would use online research and tutorials to enhance our knowledge.

The other main chanllege we would face is being able to collect the user's bank information and have a secure connection to the bank. This is a must requirement as no user would feel safe with using a service that doesn't encrypt any sensitive details or have a SSL certificate. To get a SSL certificate, a thrid party website could be used. On the website "GoDaddy" they offer a price of £43.99 a year and offer a warranty of USD $100,000.00(Standard SSL DV). This is the lower offer, the higher offer consits of a Premium SSL EV for £119.99 a year. Stating it is the "Best for eCommerce websites, Validates domain ownership and highest level of organization authentication, High-assurance green address bar (https) and a warrenty of USD $1,000,000.00.

[More information from GoDaddy](https://uk.godaddy.com/web-security/ssl-certificate/options/add-ons?src=ac&plan=ssl_001sites_tier1_024mo)

If the creation of the app and the certification on the app was approved and available to users, then the app would have to be published. To get an andriod app publsihed the andriod developers website states that there are a range of steps:

     -Preparing your app for release
     -Releasing your app to users.
          -Releasing through an app marketplace ; releasing your apps on Google Play
          -Releasing your application through email
     -Releasing through a website
     -User opt-in for unknown apps and sources
     -Allowing users to grant permission to nstalling unknown apps
     -Unknown sources
     -Maintainence

[More Information about publishing an app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/)

This is showing how to submit you app to the app store:
![](https://easternpeak.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/iOS-App-submit-to-apple-process.jpg)

Once all of this has been done and achieved then a one time purchase of $25 (£20) under a Google Wallet Merchant account. For the Apple's store then there is a cost of around $99 (around £80). Once these have been completed then the app can be publsihed. It know just needs to be maintained (not counting the cost of that as we are just the developers).

### VIII. Evualuation

The software lifecycle that was used in the waterfall model [Full Waterfall description](https://github.com/AoifeW123/Unit-9-Software-Development-Lifecycles-/blob/master/LO1%20.md#waterfall-model). The waterfall method follows these steps:

Requirements – are the documents that focuses on the description of what the company want the application to do, achieve, the functions, visual design… these must be met, and the development must match the mentioned requirements. The client and these requirements provide these will dictate the rest of development. This is especially true when it comes to the design phase of the model.

Design / System Design – is where the requirements are analysed, and a plan is created on what the project will look like, what it does and if it meets all the requirements stated. This step is also used to specify any hardware or software requirements that may have not been mentioned. Front-end and back-end system design to ensure the project will meet the brief.

Implementation – is the starting of the project, where it is going to be created, and all the requirements that need to be implemented. These are often demos and iterations of the project to understand what to needs to be included. All of which are based on the previous design. Both the requirements and the design plan direct the implementations. This results in feedback on the whole development: good or bad.

Testing and integration (Verification) – this is the step where the project is integrated onto a system for testing. This is testing for overall functionality, specifically this is checking for any errors and flaws that must be corrected. This is seeing if the code works and then fixing any bugs occur as the code is running. To ensure stability heavy testing will be constantly used through the testing phase.

Maintenance – this step will only be used after installation. Once the project has been completed and released, the software will have to be maintained. Bugs that may have not appeared during testing, may occur. These will have to be fixed. The project may be edited to stay relevant and this may include adding new features when needed.


Aoife: Documenting from information gathered.

Eric: Creating high fidelity and notes on technical details

Mohammed: Research and the use of tools and techniques

I (Aoife) took role of project manager of the project. This included having to manage the tasks both Eric and Mohammed were set to complete. The user requirements were dicussed by all and Eric took notes. From here I (Aoife) created teh user personas with help from Eric as he had some previous knowledge in this area. We established the target audience as a group and I wrote the full description of a target audience. I outlined the Epics and genre of the project. The final task I done was the budget, using the research from the technical knowledge the budget was brought together.

I (Eric) contributed to  development stage of the design. This specifically was the high fidelity. I used already known knowledge of photoshop to create simple design from the low fidelity. I also contributed to the general knowledge in technical details. I used prior exsperience in Andriod studio as a guidence as to why it is used. I found real exspectations for applcaitions and passed that onto Aoife to document. I have also worked along side Aoife and Mohammed to discuss the requirements and what are in the low fidelity designs.

I (Mohammed) worked along side Aoife and Eric to establish the user requirements and the low fidelity. I also provided some of the research for the overall project. I was mainly tasked with getting the reseach for what takeaway apps look like, what they include and the overall feasabiltiy of the project. I found research based on the tool and techniques in a software investigation.

Here is some evidence of our communications. Unfortunatly alot of notes were made on paper and thrown away, once typed up.

![](https://github.com/AoifeW123/Unit-9-Software-Development-Lifecycles-/blob/master/Basil/images/Mo's%20evidence.jpg)


Overall, the project was a great team effort as the user requirements were defined and met. The team managed to create low and high fidelity designs an little to none faults were made. Whilst the waterfall method was hard to follow the team managed to follow each step and move on by the date set in the Gantt Chart; regardless of the team not being able to actually create the project, due to short time.
